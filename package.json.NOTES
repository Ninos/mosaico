- tinymce is "locked" to 4.5.12 because of major issues with the newer releases
  (still broken in 4.8.0)
- grunt-release is "locked" to 0.13.1 because 0.14.0 is broken and no new 
  releases have been made since that.
- cheerio is "locked" to 1.0.0-rc.6 because 1.0.0-rc.10 doesn't support $(html)
  anymore.

Other:

- we manually declare "postcss" as a devDependencies because @ladder/grunt-postcss 
  does not declare it as a dependency.
